Like every museum, the National Archives boasts several new exhibits at a time—new exhibitions about American history and art. But a series of new \"re-releases,\" including the latest edition of The American Revolution in 1775, have brought in more than $1 billion in public funding, creating a much-needed library that includes nearly three million books and hundreds of thousands of artifacts. The new volumes of The American Revolution, an exhaustive look at the historical and creative life of the American Revolution, are part of such a massive collection of American history and art that the Library of Congress is opening nearly 30 new collections between now and the end of May.
